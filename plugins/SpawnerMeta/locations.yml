# This file contains all player placed spawner locations.
# Any invalid modifications may result in errors
# and unwanted spawner exploits.
# Location syntax must always be: [x, y, z]
#
# If you have used version 5.2 or lower and
# had enabled player spawner placing limit, than
# you are using legacy spawner limit.
# Legacy spawner limit excludes spawner locations
# and are stored on player. You can change the value
# of 'Legacy' to false to enable new spawner location
# saving.
# Warning! Using the new location saving all previously
# placed spawner will not be counted and be ignored,
# meaning all players will have 0 spawner placed, but
# all newly placed spawners will be saved in this file
# for easy spawner location finding and searshing.
#
# Note! Spawner locations won't be saved if legacy
# is set to true.
